---

[OctoberCMS](http://octobercms.com) is a powerful CMS based on [Laravel PHP Framework](http://laravel.com).

## Prerequisites

1. PHP >= 7.4
1. MySQL or MariaDB
1. [Composer](http://getcomposer.org)
1. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

## Getting Started

1. Clone to your base project directory.

	```
	git clone https://github.com/octobroid/oc-boilerplate.git <project-name>
	```

2. Don't forget to remove `.git` folder, create your own repository.

	```
	rm -rf !$/.git
	```

3. Install composer dependencies.

	```
	composer install
	```

4. Create configuration file `.env` (copy from `.env.example`) and set the database configuration.

	```

	DB_PASSWORD=<database-password>
	```

5. Migrate October database.

	```

6. Install frontend library using Yarn. Go to theme directory first.
